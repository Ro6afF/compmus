    \section{Introduction}
        \subsection {Frequency relations (tuning)}
        \paragraph{} The sound is a type of mechanical vibration (waves) so it has the parameters of all the normal mechanical waves. However in the field of music we are most interested in the frequency of the wave, because it makes the variety of tones we hear. But not every sequence of frequencies sounds pleasant to the human. So the people developed some algorithms to ``syncronize'' the sequence of tunes. Here are the most used of them:

            \subsubsection {Pythagorean tuning} 
            \paragraph{} The Pythagorean tuning\cite{pythtun} is the base of almost all tuning systems. It is based on the Pythagorean fractions.\\
                \begin{figure}[h]
                    $$f = \frac{i + 1}{i} ;\ i = 1, 2, ..., n$$
                    \caption{Pythagorean fractions}
                \end{figure}\paragraph{}
                It is assumed that if the frequencies correlate like these numbers, we hear them in harmony and the music will sound pleasant (if we select appropriate sequence of these tones of course).\paragraph{}
                If we pick a string with given length we know that the frequency of the produced sound depends on the length of the string. So to pick the ``perfect'' fraction we have to divide it like the Pythagorean fractions.

            \subsubsection{Equal temperament}
            \paragraph{}Equal temperament is a tuning scale developed by Vincenzo Galilei. His idea is that the frequency ratio between each pair of adjacent notes is the same. In equal temperament tunings, the generating interval is often found by dividing some larger desired interval into a number of smaller equal steps (equal frequency ratios between neighbouring notes). The tones are divided in groups called octaves. The ratio between the frequencies of last and the first tone of the octave is two.
                $$\frac{last\ tune}{first\ tune} = \frac{2}{1}$$ \paragraph{}
                In the Western music, the most commonly used tuning system since the 18th century has been the twelve-tone equal temperament(or 12-TET)\cite{12tet}. The 12-TET devides the octave in 12 eqal parts, all of them equal on logarithmic scale, with ratio $\sqrt[12]{2} = 2^\frac{1}{12} \approx 1.05946$. In modern times 12-TET is usually tunned relatively to the standard frequency of 440 Hz, called A4, meaning that the note A is tuned to 440 Hz and all other note are derived by the logarithmic scale described above. \paragraph{}
                Equal temperament is an approximation of the Pythagorean scale, which is more convenient for use.\\

        \subsection {MIDI standart}
        \paragraph{} The purpose of MIDI\cite{midi} is to define a way compact representation of musical sheets, which makes it appropriate for disk storage.\paragraph{}
            The standard MIDI(SMID) file is divided into chunks. Each chunk has a type and length represented as ASCII and 32 bit number respectively. There are two types of chunks: ``MThd''(e.g. Header chunk) and ``MTrk''(e.g. Track chunk). There is always one header while there can be more than one track.
            \subsubsection{Header chunk}
            \paragraph{}The header chunk contains data for the whole file. It has fixed length of 6 bytes. The first 2 bytes represent the format of file:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item 0 $\to$ One track
                    \item 1 $\to$ Multiple tracks but one song
                    \item 2 $\to$ Multiple song
                \end{itemize}
                The second 2 bytes represent the number of tracks. For format 0 it is always 1. And the last two bytes represent how many ticks are in a quarter note.
            \subsubsection{Track chunks}
            \paragraph{}Each track is composed of events. Each event has delta time - the time (in ticks) which passes after the previous event before executing this event. There are two types of events: MIDI events - the ones which represent the actual music and META - these which supply additional info like titles, lyrics, etc.
            \paragraph{}Here are listed the most important events(however they are useless without the others):
            \begin{itemize}
                \item NOTEON - this event initiates playing with given pitch (frequency) and velocity. The MIDI representation of this event is:\\
                    \textit{``1001nnnn 0kkkkkkk 0vvvvvvv''} where nnnn is the binary representation of the channel, kkkkkkk - the pitch and vvvvvvv - the velocity
                \item NOTEOFF - this event stops playing with given pitch (frequency). And the intensity of the stop. The MIDI representation of this event is:\\
                    \textit{``1000nnnn 0kkkkkkk 0vvvvvvv''} where nnnn is the binary representation of the channel, kkkkkkk - the pitch and vvvvvvv - the velocity
            \end{itemize}
            \paragraph{} Each MIDI event that has to play note uses this standard for encoding the frequency of the played tune\cite{midifreq}:
            $$f = 440 * 2^\frac{d - 69}{12}\ where\ d\ is\ the\ note\ number\ and\ f\ is\ the\ frequency$$
            Therefore the note number is:
            $$d = 69 + 12\log_2 \frac{f}{440}$$
        \subsection{Markov chains}
        \paragraph{}Markov chain\cite{markov} is a stochastic model which describes a sequence of events in which the probability of each event depends entirely on the previous event (in some cases the previous $n$ but the table which describes the chain size becomes big quickly because it equals to $k^n\ where\ k\ is\ the\ number\ of\ events$).\paragraph{}
                Markov chains are represented as table in the most cases. Each cell of the table hold the probability of triggering an event from the row/column after the event in the column/row respectively (see Figure \ref{fig:markov}).

            \subsubsection{Algorithm with one tune pitch}
            \paragraph{}This algorithm constructs a Markov table based only on the frequencies of the tones. The size of the table depends on the variety of tunes used. Then it selects starting note and each next note is picked using random number generator and the chances in the Markov chain.
            \subsubsection{Algorithm with one tune pitch and note duration}
            \paragraph{}This algorithm constructs a Markov table based on the frequencies of the tones and their length. Because of this the size of the table increases and the size depends ont only on the variety of notes but on the variety of note lengths. Then it selects starting note and each next note is picked using random number generator and the chances in the Markov chain.
            \subsubsection{Algorithm with two tune pitch}
            \paragraph{}This algorithm constructs a Markov table based only on the frequencies of the tones but it calculates the chance of next event, based ont he previous two, so the size of the table increases and is the size of the table in 1.4.1 sqared. Then it selects starting note and each next note is picked using random number generator and the chances in the Markov chain.
            \subsubsection{Rust}
            \paragraph{}All the implementations of the algorithms for the project are written in Rust programming language\cite{rust}. It is based on C but it guarantees memory safety, threads without data races, generics(templates) and the standard library is bigger and has some bindings for functional programming.
    \section{Results}

    \section{Future}
        \paragraph{}The future of the project aims developing more algorithms for composing music and statistical models. Here are listed the planned improvements:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Parallelize the algorithms to improve the speed of the construction of the table because on large amount of notes the algorithm that use the length of the notes is too slow
            \item Implement the algorithm that uses a pair of notes and their lengths to predict the next one
            \item Use Markov chains to check the similarity of two musical pieces
            \item Use neural networks generate music
            \item Implement other algorithms
        \end{enumerate}
